		<div>After a bill is assigned to a standing committee the chairperson of the committee assigns it to a subcommittee where the real work is done.  The subcommittees research the bills, hold hearings on the bill, rewrite the bill in  markup session and finally send the bill back to the standing committee with the report.  All these steps hold potential pitfalls for the bill. If the bill is not thoroughly researched in sub committee it will be subject to questions raised further down its path through Congress.  Hearings on the bill by both experts and the general public can be both positive or negative testimony and  cannot only influence the members votes but also if  their televised or reported in the press affect public opinion.  Marking up the bill can change the bill  by strengthening or weakening it.  The subcommittee report on the bill which can be positive or negative will have a big affect on the vote of the full standing committee. And   finally the subcommittee is the first place a Bill can get pigeonholed, held up in progress stopped in Congress

		<div>Standing CommitteeThe standing committees of Congress are the specialists of Congress.  Each committee specializes in a particular subject area and all bills or other concerns  which come before Congress that fall into that area are referred to the committee, thus the judicial committee will get all laws concerning the court system and other matters such as judicial appointments the nature of laws and become so specialized that Congress as a whole relies on the expertise of these committees.  Congress will seldom  override a negative report by these committees  or vote to discharge a bill from a committee. Because of this the power of the standing committee and its chairman over bills in their charge is significant.  Standing committee can hold bills forever  effectively preventing the passage into law. The members of the committee are given precedents and speak for or against the bill on the  floor should it get that far.  In the event that it passes in one house and goes to the conference, members of the committee are the conferees all this adds up to a potential trap for your bill you must invest your efforts in logrolling and work carefully to avoid the trap of the standing committee having the chairperson as a friend also helps</div>

On the other hand  the special rule can be written so that each section the bill can be considered separately thus allowing it to be voted on piecemeal.  The length of time given to debate can also be too determined by the special rule, even who is allowed to speak for your bill on the house floor .

		<div>The Congressional Plumbing System

In this simulation the metaphor of a plumbing system is used to help understand the United States Congress, the legislative process and the role a Congressman plays in making laws.
In this analogy, you the player, will assume the role of a Congressman /Plumber.  At the beginning of the simulation the player is assigned relevant personal characteristics and a district to represent.  Your goal, given your particular resources and skills, is to get as many bills passed through Congress as you can.  As a Congressman you represent a specific district so, depending on which district you represent, some bills are more important to you than others and each bill will have a different effect on your score.  Passage of a bill, which can help your district, will give you more points than passage of one less relevant to your district.  Your first task then as a Congressman, is to make a wise choice of bills to sponsor; ones, which will benefit your district.  Your score increases with the passage of your bills.
How to be a Congressman/Plumber
Choosing a bill to get passed into law.
The choice of bills you attempt to pass should be consistent with the interest of the district you represent.  There are eight bills in the bill reservoir.  Information about each bill is found by clicking the information button beside the bill. Two of the bills are very important to your district and their passage are, therefore, more then they would normally be worth.  The importance of a particular bill can be deduced from the descriptions of the bill and the district you represent.
Two of the bills in the reservoir are very difficult to get passed through Congress; they will each face four obstacles.  Three bills are moderately difficult; they will face three obstacles.  Two are easy; they will only face two obstacles each.  Choosing an easy bill would seem to be the smartest thing to do but the score for passing an easy bill is one point .  Passage of a moderately difficult bill earns you two points and passage of each difficult bill will earn you three points.
The description of a bill is accessed by clicking on the info button next to the particular bill.
Once you have chosen a bill, click the start button on the control panel and enter the bill's number from the options. The bill will then start on its way through the system.
Your job in moving your bill through Congress begins when the bill encounters its first obstacle.  As a Congressman/Plumber you have a control panel to help you.   Your success in moving a bill through the various blockages in Congress depends on your political friends; correct use of your tools,   effort you put into working for your bill and logrolling; and of course luck.  

The control panel
Your control panel contains all the things a Congressman/Plumber needs to open the valves and clear the traps found in the Congressional Plumbing System. It contains:
. a Friends button from which you can choose the political Friends needed to help you during your term in office.

. a Logrolling and Work buttons that can be used adjust the effort level of each to fit the particular obstacle your bill faces.

. A Efforts Points button where you replenish effort  you used up trying to free your bill by demonstrating your knowledge of Congress.




How to get your bill through the congressional.
Your first task should probably be to read about the bill by clicking the bills info button. Next discover the nature of the particular obstacle the bill has encountered by clicking its info button.  
The obstacles, which your bill will face, fall into two broad groups, traps and shut off valves.
Traps are just that, places in Congress where your bill can get trapped.  In Congress the traps  are usually committees but all traps are not the same and neither are  all committees of Congress the same.  A trap will kill a bill by holding it and not allowing any action to be taken on it.
Shutoff valves can stop the flow of a bill.  They are specific things such as presidential vetoes, poor committee assignments, negative amendments to the bill and etc.
To discover the specific nature of the traps and shutoff valves click on the “?” button for the obstacle you have encountered.
After you have thoroughly investigated the particular obstacle blocking your bill,  adjust the log rolling and work buttons for amount of each type of effort it will take to free your bill. You do not want to expend too much or too little effort, so you must have the correct mix between work and logrolling to free your bill.
Every Congressman has limited effort available to him (only so many hours in a day).  As this simulation begins you have 50 Effort Units.  You can, however, increase the effort with your Know How, i.e. knowledge of Congress.  The more knowledge you have of Congress, the more efficiently and skillfully you can use that effort and thus enhance its effect.  Your knowledge of Congress is demonstrated by answering questions by clicking the Know How button on your Control Panel.  There are 120 questions and each correctly answered question earns an additional effort unit.  Thus it is possible for you to begin this simulation with as many as 170 effort units.
As in Congress, another thing that effects your effort, either increasing or decreasing its effectiveness, is who can help you.  If you have powerful Friends in the right place,  your effort on behalf of your bill will be increased.  Every time you try to free a bill from a particular obstacle there is the chance that something will go wrong and you will fail to free the bill.  Thirty percent of the time you will fail to free your bill even though it is properly adjusted, but, with the proper  friend in the right place, this risk is cut in half.

Friends  are chosen at the beginning of your term of office.  To choose Friends, click  on the Friends button and a list of eight titles of Congressmen will be presented.  The Congressmen have varying  degrees of power.  Some are extremely powerful and have general power, which  can be exerted throughout the Congress.  Their power can help you clear the obstacle your bill faces no matter what the obstacle.  Other Friends have more specific power and are very powerful but only in specific parts of Congress.  They can be very helpful to you if an obstacle over which they have specific power holds up your bill.  There are some Congressmen on the list who are nice people and fun to be with but have very little power and will not be of much help to you. Since all you have are the titles and not information about which Congressman are more powerful than others, it will be your problem to choose the most helpful Friends.
You may choose two Friends  from the group of seven  offered.   Once you have chosen, they remain your friends for the rest of the term.  You cannot trade a friend in for a new one even if they are not proving to be as helpful as you had hoped. Thus once you have chosen you friends the friends button disappears.
After you have increased effort by demonstrating your knowledge of Congress and chosen your friends, you are ready to do something about choosing the effort in both logrolling and working to free the bill of yours stuck in Congress.
Adjusting the effort levels
The effort levels can be adjusted to overcome the different types of blockages by use of the correct mix of effort placed in the two major components Logrolling and Working for the Bill.

Logrolling activities that require effort include:1. Contacting fellow Congressman to persuade them to vote for your bill.2. Doing favors for fellow Congressman in return for help they give you on your bill.3. Vote counting, finding out how Congressmen may vote on your bill.
Working for the  Bill includes:1. Testifying before various committees of Congress in support of the bill.2. Building public support for your bill.3. Researching your bill.4. Developing and implementing various parliamentary strategies for the bill.

You adjust the effort levels in both working and log rolling by clicking on the work and logroll buttons and making your choice. Once your choices are made you click on the “free” button below the obstacle you are trying to free. If successful your bill will move along the system if not you can go back and readjust your effort or start another bill.


If your effort levels were correct,and the most effective Friends have been  selected and luck is on your side, the  bill will be freed and proceed on its trip through the Congress.  If the bill remains blocked you must readjust you effort levels or select a new bill. 
Sequence of play
. Initiate the game
Click the Start button on the title page and  your resume as a Congressman appears.  Read this resume carefully for it will be very important in determining which bills are important to your district and thus which bills you choose to increase your score. Then click start game button and you be transported to the control board. Here are all the tools you will need to move your bill through the congressional water works.




. Moving  a bill through Congress

Step 1 Select the two friends to want in congress. Give careful consideration; you can only choose once.
Step 2 Choose the bill you wish start in the system and the select it by clicking the start bill button. Give careful consideration to your role and the nature of the bill before making your choice.
Step 3 When the bill encounters it’s first block adjust the effort you think will be necessary to logrolling  and work to free the bill.
Step 4 Click on the “free” button for the blockage of your bill.Step 5 If bill is free and moves on repeat the same process for the next blockage it encounters. If your efforts fail either try again or select a new bill.
note if need to replenish your effort click on the Know How button. When you return to the control panal you must click the contiunue button or start a new bill.

		<div>?Special Rule?
</div>
		<div>The House comittees
The house rules committee is often referred to as a traffic cop of the house. Because of the many bills introduced each term not all of them can be considered by the full House even though they are reported out of committee. When a bill is reported out of committee it is placed on the calendar  in order  for bills to be considered. by the house.  There are two calendars one for  money bills the union calendar and the house calendar for all other bills poor bills. The union calendar has precedence over the house calendar so that the only way a poor bill can get to the house floor is if the house rules committee, which controls the rules of the house, and writes a special rule temporarily suspending normal rules of the house to allow consideration of the poor bill.  Without this rule bills not dealing with taxes or large appropriations of money would never make it to the  house floor.  All this gives the house rules committee virtual control over the flow of bills onto the House floor without approval your bill not make it to the floor.

		<div>The VetoThe presidential veto is one of the most potent blocks in the legislative process. The only way to overcome a veto is by a two thirds vote in each house of the Congress this in effect gives one third of the congressman in either house the ability to prevent the passage of the bill.  In some cases you can avoid a presidential veto if you either marshal  congressional  or public  support for the bill and the president does not wish to risk the political fallout. In some cases a veto may be avoided by changing the bill in such a way as to accommodate the president's concerns. With the bill such  an action may watered-down your bill significantly but maybe this is better than no law at all.  Sometimes you can avoid the veto by attaching your bill as a rider to a bill that the president favors.  This is difficult to do if the bill is of major significance.  In any case this last block can be one of the most difficult to overcome.</div>

		<div>Defense BillThis bill will continue appropriations at or near current levels. There will however be adjustments to reflect the current world situation. There will be fewer nuclear weapons and more concentration on conventional combat forces
rationaleThe Cold War made the annual defense bill and almost untouchable sacred cow it was however more than just fear of the Russia that gave defense such clout in  Congress, it was also the military-industrial complex.  Over the years much of industry,  jobs and the economy  became  dependent on government defense spending.  The typical middle-class income in many cases traced its to source to defense spending.  When the Cold War ended with the break up of the USSR many were anticipating a peace dividend development has been slow,  however the dislocations of defense cutbacks are beginning to be felt.

		<div>The House FloorConsideration of your bill by the full house could be the ultimate trap. If it fails to pass the bill is almost surely dead and at least for this term and probably for others to come. Failing to get a majority vote however is not the only negative thing that can happen to your bill on the house floor.  Your bill can still be amended to death by the members or a  motion can be introduced sending your bill back to committee which is almost as final as a no vote.  The bill can be subject to a filibuster, a procedural one on the house floor and one of unlimited debate in the Senate.  Wheather by taking the bill to death or killing  it with ponderous procedures the result could be fatal to your bill.  Just keeping track of of all the many strategies against your bill is complicated on the floor because there's so many players in the game. There are hundred and 435 members of the house and each one has a right to speak and a  right to exercise all his or her parliamentary rights.  Under the rules of parliamentary procedure which one of the members will try to kill your bill and which one will support it and who doesn't care and can be converted to your side must be considered. These are just some of the problems of consideration by whole house and why the floor vote is a test of your legislative skills</div>

		<div>The Congressional Plumbing System

In this simulation the metaphor of a plumbing system is used to help understand the United States Congress, the legislative process and the role a Congressman plays in making laws.
In this analogy, you the player, will assume the role of a Congressman /Plumber.  At the beginning of the simulation the player is assigned relevant personal characteristics and a district to represent.  Your goal, given your particular resources and skills, is to get as many bills passed through Congress as you can.  As a Congressman you represent a specific district so, depending on which district you represent, some bills are more important to you than others and each bill will have a different effect on your score.  Passage of a bill, which can help your district, will give you more points than passage of one less relevant to your district.  Your first task then as a Congressman, is to make a wise choice of bills to sponsor; ones, which will benefit your district.  Your score increases with the passage of your bills.
How to be a Congressman/Plumber
Choosing a bill to get passed into law.
The choice of bills you attempt to pass should be consistent with the interest of the district you represent.  There are eight bills in the bill reservoir.  Information about each bill is found by clicking the information button beside the bill. Two of the bills are very important to your district and their passage are, therefore, more then they would normally be worth.  The importance of a particular bill can be deduced from the descriptions of the bill and the district you represent.
Two of the bills in the reservoir are very difficult to get passed through Congress; they will each face four obstacles.  Three bills are moderately difficult; they will face three obstacles.  Two are easy; they will only face two obstacles each.  Choosing an easy bill would seem to be the smartest thing to do but the score for passing an easy bill is one point .  Passage of a moderately difficult bill earns you two points and passage of each difficult bill will earn you three points.
The description of a bill is accessed by clicking on the info button next to the particular bill.
Once you have chosen a bill, click the start button on the control panel and enter the bill's number from the options. The bill will then start on its way through the system.
Your job in moving your bill through Congress begins when the bill encounters its first obstacle.  As a Congressman/Plumber you have a control panel to help you.   Your success in moving a bill through the various blockages in Congress depends on your political friends; correct use of your tools,   effort you put into working for your bill and logrolling; and of course luck.  

The control panel
Your control panel contains all the things a Congressman/Plumber needs to open the valves and clear the traps found in the Congressional Plumbing System. It contains:
. a Friends button from which you can choose the political Friends needed to help you during your term in office.

. a Logrolling and Work buttons that can be used adjust the effort level of each to fit the particular obstacle your bill faces.

. A Efforts Points button where you replenish effort  you used up trying to free your bill by demonstrating your knowledge of Congress.




How to get your bill through the congressional.
Your first task should probably be to read about the bill by clicking the bills info button. Next discover the nature of the particular obstacle the bill has encountered by clicking its info button.  
The obstacles, which your bill will face, fall into two broad groups, traps and shut off valves.
Traps are just that, places in Congress where your bill can get trapped.  In Congress the traps  are usually committees but all traps are not the same and neither are  all committees of Congress the same.  A trap will kill a bill by holding it and not allowing any action to be taken on it.
Shutoff valves can stop the flow of a bill.  They are specific things such as presidential vetoes, poor committee assignments, negative amendments to the bill and etc.
To discover the specific nature of the traps and shutoff valves click on the “?” button for the obstacle you have encountered.
After you have thoroughly investigated the particular obstacle blocking your bill,  adjust the log rolling and work buttons for amount of each type of effort it will take to free your bill. You do not want to expend too much or too little effort, so you must have the correct mix between work and logrolling to free your bill.
Every Congressman has limited effort available to him (only so many hours in a day).  As this simulation begins you have 50 Effort Units.  You can, however, increase the effort with your Know How, i.e. knowledge of Congress.  The more knowledge you have of Congress, the more efficiently and skillfully you can use that effort and thus enhance its effect.  Your knowledge of Congress is demonstrated by answering questions by clicking the Know How button on your Control Panel.  There are 120 questions and each correctly answered question earns an additional effort unit.  Thus it is possible for you to begin this simulation with as many as 170 effort units.
As in Congress, another thing that effects your effort, either increasing or decreasing its effectiveness, is who can help you.  If you have powerful Friends in the right place,  your effort on behalf of your bill will be increased.  Every time you try to free a bill from a particular obstacle there is the chance that something will go wrong and you will fail to free the bill.  Thirty percent of the time you will fail to free your bill even though it is properly adjusted, but, with the proper  friend in the right place, this risk is cut in half.

Friends  are chosen at the beginning of your term of office.  To choose Friends, click  on the Friends button and a list of eight titles of Congressmen will be presented.  The Congressmen have varying  degrees of power.  Some are extremely powerful and have general power, which  can be exerted throughout the Congress.  Their power can help you clear the obstacle your bill faces no matter what the obstacle.  Other Friends have more specific power and are very powerful but only in specific parts of Congress.  They can be very helpful to you if an obstacle over which they have specific power holds up your bill.  There are some Congressmen on the list who are nice people and fun to be with but have very little power and will not be of much help to you. Since all you have are the titles and not information about which Congressman are more powerful than others, it will be your problem to choose the most helpful Friends.
You may choose two Friends  from the group of seven  offered.   Once you have chosen, they remain your friends for the rest of the term.  You cannot trade a friend in for a new one even if they are not proving to be as helpful as you had hoped. Thus once you have chosen you friends the friends button disappears.
After you have increased effort by demonstrating your knowledge of Congress and chosen your friends, you are ready to do something about choosing the effort in both logrolling and working to free the bill of yours stuck in Congress.
Adjusting the effort levels
The effort levels can be adjusted to overcome the different types of blockages by use of the correct mix of effort placed in the two major components Logrolling and Working for the Bill.

Logrolling activities that require effort include:1. Contacting fellow Congressman to persuade them to vote for your bill.2. Doing favors for fellow Congressman in return for help they give you on your bill.3. Vote counting, finding out how Congressmen may vote on your bill.
Working for the  Bill includes:1. Testifying before various committees of Congress in support of the bill.2. Building public support for your bill.3. Researching your bill.4. Developing and implementing various parliamentary strategies for the bill.

You adjust the effort levels in both working and log rolling by clicking on the work and logroll buttons and making your choice. Once your choices are made you click on the “free” button below the obstacle you are trying to free. If successful your bill will move along the system if not you can go back and readjust your effort or start another bill.


If your effort levels were correct,and the most effective Friends have been  selected and luck is on your side, the  bill will be freed and proceed on its trip through the Congress.  If the bill remains blocked you must readjust you effort levels or select a new bill. 
Sequence of play
. Initiate the game
Click the Start button on the title page and  your resume as a Congressman appears.  Read this resume carefully for it will be very important in determining which bills are important to your district and thus which bills you choose to increase your score. Then click start game button and you be transported to the control board. Here are all the tools you will need to move your bill through the congressional water works.




. Moving  a bill through Congress
